# Flight Computer Code
Flight computer for the UK Rocketry competition 2025. We are using a teensy 4.0, with a BMP390 and the altimu-10 v6 (maybe).

## The Plan

## Libraries 

- FreeRTOS for teensy
- Tiny FS
- libs for sensors

## Sensor Data Statistics

## Key Algorithms
- Kalman filter
- Runge-Kutta for accelerometer integration
- Discrete differential approximation (for the barometer)
